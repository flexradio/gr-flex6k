       * \brief Return a shared_ptr to a new instance of flex6k::flex6k_sink.
       *
       * To avoid accidental use of raw pointers, flex6k::flex6k_sink's
       * constructor is in a private implementation
       * class. flex6k::flex6k_sink::make is the public interface for
       * creating new instances.
       * 
       * \param txMode
       * this is the transmitter mode, a enum type:
       * unimplemented Continuous with Forced Stop:
       * ----Externaly activated/deactivated.
       * ----When in tx mode, sends data as availiable.
       * ----when Tx requests to stop, stops immediately.
       * 
       * unimplemented Continuous with Delayed Stop:
       * ----Externaly activated/deactivated.
       * ----When in tx mode, sends data as availiable.
       * ----when Tx requests to stop, continues to transmit until out of data.
       * 
       * Continuous with Auto Start and Auto Stop:
       * ----Auto-activates when data is on the input buffer and sob.
       * ----When in tx mode, sends data while availiable.
       * ----When no more data, auto deactivates.
       * 
       * unimplemented Burst with Auto Start and Auto Stop w/o Timestamps:
       * ----Requires tx_sob and tx_eob tags.
       * ----Auto-activates when data is on the input buffer.
       * ----When in tx mode, sends data as availiable.
       * ----When eob, auto deactivates.
       * 
       * unimplemented Burst with Auto Start and Auto Stop w/ Timestamps:
       * ----Requires tx_sob and tx_eob tags.
       * ----Auto-activates when data is on the input buffer.
       * ----When in tx mode, sends data as availiable.
       * ----When eob, auto deactivates.
       * 
       * All of the above can accept tx_freq, and tx_command tags
       * TSB are not implemented...
